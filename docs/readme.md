# Welcome to the WRF-PartMC Documentation!

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to setting up and running simulations using [WRF-PartMC](https://github.com/open-atmos/wrf-partmc), a modeling system that integrates the [Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)](https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/models/wrf) model with [PartMC](https://github.com/compdyn/partmc) (Particle-resolved Monte Carlo code for atmospheric aerosol simulation). A scientific overview of WRF-PartMC is in [Curtis et al. (2024)](https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2024/egusphere-2024-825/).

## Getting Started
* ðŸŒ± **New to WRF/WRF-PartMC?** Start by setting up the required dependencies and compiling the model. For detailed instructions, head over to the [Installation Guide](installation.md) to get started.

* ðŸš€ **Already installed and compiled?** Congratulations, you're now ready to dive into WRF-PartMC! We highly recommend exploring the [WRF-ARW Online Tutorial](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/OnLineTutorial/Introduction/index.php) provided by NCAR to understand the fundamentals of WRF model setup and configuration. <ins>*Alternatively*</ins>, you can explore the sections below for a concise guide on its key components and functionality.
