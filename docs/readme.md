# Welcome to WRF-PartMC Documentation!

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to setting up and running simulations using 
[WRF-PartMC](https://github.com/open-atmos/wrf-partmc), a modeling system that integrates the 
[Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)](https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/models/wrf) model with 
[PartMC](https://github.com/compdyn/partmc) (Particle-resolved Monte Carlo code for 
atmospheric aerosol simulation). A scientific overview of WRF-PartMC is in 
[Curtis et al. (2024)](https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2024/egusphere-2024-825/).

## Getting Started
* ðŸŒ± **New to WRF/WRF-PartMC?** Start by setting up the required dependencies and compiling the model. 
For detailed instructions, head over to the [Installation Guide](#installation-guide) to get started.

* ðŸš€ **Already installed and compiled?** Congratulations! You're now ready to dive into WRF-PartMC. We 
highly recommend exploring the [WRF-ARW Online Tutorial](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/OnLineTutorial/Introduction/index.php) 
provided by NCAR to understand the fundamentals of WRF model setup and configuration. **Alternatively**, you can 
explore the sections below for a concise guide on its key components and functionality.
